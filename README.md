# Linear-Regression
Linear regression is an sticistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The most common form of linear regression is simple linear regression, which deals with the relationship between two variables.

The relationship between the variables is linear, meaning that the change in the dependent variable is proportional to the change in the independent variables.

Simple Linear Regression:

Given a dataset, where x is the independent variable and y is the dependent variable, simple linear regression aims to find the best-fitting straight line through the data points.
The line is represented by the equation:

"y = mx +  b"

Where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, m is the slope of the line, and b is the y-intercept."

In the case of multiple linear regression with more than one independent variable, the equation becomes:
"y = m1x1+ m2x2+ m3x3+......... +  b"

Where y is the dependent variable,
x1,x2,x3....... is the independent variable, 
m1,m2,m3......is the slope of the line,
and b is the y-intercept."
